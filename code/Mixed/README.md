## Mixed Workloads
For comparing `ThreadPoolExecutor` with `ProcessPoolExecutor` with mixed workloads, the tasks of interest would need to involve both I/O and CPU workloads. As such, the tasks we delegated for the mixed workloads were standard image processing (resizing an image and saving it to the directory) and ML image classification (through the ResNet18 model). These tasks involve both I/O-bound operations, such as loading, reading, and saving images, as well as CPU-bound operations, such as image resizing and model computation. 

Both tasks are done on a set of three images: a high resolution image (1792x1024), a low resolution image (1024x1024), and a white noise image. The high resolution and low resolution images were each randomly chosen from their own respective set of 5 images, while the white noise image was randomly generated. This image selection and generation process ensures some ensemble of randomness and variety in our workload more suitable for a real-world context, rather than performing these tasks with the same set of images every run. To evaluate the efficiency of the two executor classes, we measured time, throughput, CPU usage, and memory usage for each of the tasks with each executor. 


### Files 
- `image_processing.py`: A Jupyter Notebook containing code for opening and resizing the three images. Measures time taken for thread pool execution and process pool execution for this operation.
- `ML_image_processing.py`: A Jupyter Notebook containing code for classifying the three images based on a pretrained ResNet18 model. Measures the time taken for thread pool execution and process pool execution for this operation.
- `image_gen.py`: A file containing the functions for randomly choosing the high/low res images and for generating the random white noise image.
- **high-res-images**: A folder containing five high resolution JPG files (high-res-1.jpg, high-res-2.jpg, etc.) All images were generated by artificial intelligence.
- **low-res-images**: A folder containing five low resolution JPG files (low-res-1.jpg, low-res-2.jpg, etc.) All images were generated by artificial intelligence.
