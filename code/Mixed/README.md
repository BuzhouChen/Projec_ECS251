## Mixed Workloads
The mixed workloads section for this project focuses on images, with both standard image processing as well as machine learning image classification. In both of these avenues, we measure the time take for thread pool execution vs process pool execution for each task.

Each type of image proecssing relies on three images: a high resolution picture, a low resolution picture, and a white noise picture. The high-res image and low-res image are chosen at random prior to the beginning of the process. The white noise image is generated by Python prior to the beginning of the process. This is to add some randomness and to ensure that there is some variety with our inputs, as we do not wish to take the same inputs on every run.

### Files 
- `image_process.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing code for opening and resizing the three images. Measures time taken for thread pool execution and process pool execution for this operation.
- `ML_image_processing.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing code for classifying the three images based on a pretrained ResNet18 model. Measures the time taken for thread pool execution and process pool execution for this operation.
- `image_gen.py`: A file containing the functions for randomly choosing the high/low res images and for generating the random white noise image.
- **high-res-images**: A folder containing five high resolution JPG files (high-res-1.jpg, high-res-2.jpg, etc.) All images were generated by artificial intelligence.
- **low-res-images**: A folder containing five low resolution JPG files (low-res-1.jpg, low-res-2.jpg, etc.) All images were generated by artificial intelligence.
